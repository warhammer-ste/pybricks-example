# pybricks-example
All of these programs are written to be run on a LEGO Brick using EV3 MicroPython v2.0

This code assumes you are using the starter build as defined by LEGO (will link later), and will assume you add modifications to it based off sensors used.
There are no example photos of how you should add the modifications. I will try adding explanations of how I modified my robot to accomodate the robot in my freetime.

These programs were written for a course in school, and will likely not receieve any updates after my graduation as I do not have the money for LEGO Robotics unfortunately.
These were originally ported because I realised certain projects (that use images) won't have any examples..

# Prerequisites
EV3 MicroPython v2.0 installed on your LEGO Robot as outlined by LEGO in this article: https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/teacher-resources/python-for-ev3/
  - I used Rufus to flash it onto the SD.
Visual Code Studio
  - You can use another code editor if you really want to, but these programs were made in VCS and LEGO also assumes you use VCS.
EV3's extension in VCS.
  - Just search up EV3 in the extensions tab. You are looking for the extension made by "LEGO® Education"
Despite the program stating that it is MicroPython, you should have a baseline of Python knowledge (or really good research skills) as it doesn't differ extremely from Python.
