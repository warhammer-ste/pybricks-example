# pybricks-example
This repository is intended to be example programs dedicated for a classroom. Code is done by an amateur, and suggestions are welcome.

This code assumes you are using the starter build as defined by LEGO (will link later), and will assume you add modifications to it based off sensors used.
There are no example photos of how you should add the modifications. I will try adding explanations of how I modified my robot to accomodate the robot in my freetime.

This is mainly meant as a small-group kind of repository, but I don't really mind it accidentally gets found on Google.
All of these programs are written to be run on EV3 MicroPython v2.0
