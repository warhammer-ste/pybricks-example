# pybricks-example
All of these programs are written to be run on EV3 MicroPython v2.0

This code assumes you are using the starter build as defined by LEGO (will link later), and will assume you add modifications to it based off sensors used.
There are no example photos of how you should add the modifications. I will try adding explanations of how I modified my robot to accomodate the robot in my freetime.

These programs were written for a course in school, and will likely not receieve any updates after my graduation as I do not have the money for LEGO Robotics unfortunately.
These were originally ported because I realised certain projects (that use images) won't have any examples..
